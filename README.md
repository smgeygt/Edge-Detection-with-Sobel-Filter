# Edge-Detection-with-Sobel-Filter
This repository aims to perform edge detection using the Sobel filter. 
The Sobel filter is a commonly used technique in image processing for edge detection.

## What is the Sobel Filter?
The Sobel filter is a gradient filter used to detect edges in an image. It analyzes the intensity changes at each pixel of the image to identify edges. The Sobel filter is calculated as a combination of gradients in the x and y directions, and then the edge strength is determined using the magnitudes of these gradients.

## Usage
Downloading the Code: Clone this repository to your local machine or download it as a ZIP file.

Installing Required Libraries: To run the project, you'll need the OpenCV library. If you don't have OpenCV installed, you can follow the installation instructions from the official OpenCV website.

Running the Code: Execute the Python file sobel_edge_detection.py to perform edge detection using the Sobel filter. To detect edges in a sample image using the Sobel filter, run the following command:
...
[python sobel_edge_detection.py --input image.jpg --output edges.jpg]
...
Here, image.jpg represents the input image for edge detection, and edges.jpg represents the output image where the detected edges will be saved.
